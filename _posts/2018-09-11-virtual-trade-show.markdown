This article tackles and compares usual trade fairs with Virtual Reality trade fairs. Involved people know the workings of  trade shows, their  advantages and disadvantages . Their have been some attempts to run virtual trades hows complementary to physical trade shows.  How does the future of trade shows look like? Could the virtual show  even replace the physical one  or is this Science-Fiction? 

Leading manufacturing companies already apply VR showrooms these days to present their machines, simultaneously saving costs and gaining new leads. But this is an expensive investment and has been reserved to leadings companies only, hasn’t it?


### Introduction Virtual trade fairs:

Showcasing your machine in Virtual Reality means that you need VR glasses (like HTC Vive, Occulus or GearVR), an application where your machine(s) is shown in 3D space and maybe some additional equipment like controller and sensors depending on the appliance and needs.
Having this set-up everyone can take a look at your machine everywhere in VR.
One set of such kind of equipment may cost between $500 and $1500 excluding the development of the application, so the equipment can be obtained for an affordable price. 
Why Virtual trade shows have been reserved for leading companies have two major reasons:

#### 1. Application Costs:
Developing such an application can easily reach 6 figure sum or even much higher depending on the complexity.

#### 2. Lack of knowledge about Virtual Reality: 
Virtual Reality is a very fast expanding and new industry which finds new appliance daily. In addition, not many people have tried VR applications at all or haven’t experienced applications for the industry. This makes it hard for people to see the benefits.

This article will treat both issues, but first why even use VR solutions and why are they even so interesting for leading companies?

### Comparing usual trade shows and Virtual trade shows:

Let's do the math to understand one point why Virtual trade fairs are saving money for companies in first place. To do that we take an example of a company showcasing 3 machines on trade fairs and compare it to a VR solution.

You can see that with a VR solution this company saves 406.000 EUR every trade fair over 10 years and the investment for a VR solution is already covered in the first trade show. Also, if meanwhile the machines need to be taken out of the daily production line, additional financial losses occur, which are omitted with the VR solution.

### Benefits of VR:

Beside hugh savings, does the VR solution bring other advantages? The answer is simply yes! and even a lot of them. Here are some main Key Points:

- #### Showcasing machines which are not yet developed
Presenting clients your machine which is still in the developing process and collecting already orders.

- #### No limitation by space
	In VR you have all the space you need without any limitations to the booth size.
- #### Providing a guided tour through your machine
A guided tour means that the user can just lean back and take a scripted tour about your machine, highlighting the most important features and point out benefits. 
- #### Hidden processes can be revealed within the working machine
An important feature of VR is that you can show everything you imagine, for example make the covers of you machine transparent and show hidden processes while the machine is working.
- #### Quick exchange to show variations of your machine
If there are different variation or customizable machine parts, you can exchange them with one “klick”.
- #### The VR technology naturally attracts more visitors, what has an positive impact for new leads
	Companies with a Virtual trade show have noticed a 30% raise of potential clients
- #### The VR technology supports the impression of an innovative company
	As VR is a new and innovative technology this impression will reflect on your company.
- #### You can use the VR solution as well for other purposes and not only on trade fairs
For example to showcase many different machines to clients anywhere, anytime. Or as a stand alone  marketing tool in addition to usual prospects and graphics.
- #### Flexibility
Transporting a big machine always includes a lot of planning and skilled employees limiting your flexibility. This is omitted with the VR solution as you only need one person with a case flying to clients in any moment. Just make an appointment and you are ready to go.

### Are there any obstacles with Virtual Trade Shows and can they be solved?

Short answer is yes, but the list is also very short.
- #### You can not touch the real machine
As we are all humans, we like to touch things, feel them, smell them. Unfortunately this is not possible in VR (not yet developed to a high standard). This issue is almost completely overcome by taking one or a few machines to the trade fairs and a lot more in VR. This way the visitors can link the real machines to your machines in VR. Also, with today's standards the VR is so immersive, that people forget quickly that they are in a virtual world and start acting like in the real world after one or a few minutes.
- #### People without knowledge of modern technology might have trouble getting used to VR
Some people which didn’t get in touch with modern technology, need a few more minutes to get used to VR. To shorten the learning process, an intuitive tutorial is created which gives a fast entrain. On the other hand it was noticed that a lot of non-technical peoples are even more attracted to try a new technology and have a greater experience in the end. The highest reported amount of getting used to an application is about 5 min. Usually it takes less than 1 minute.
- #### Motion sickness
1,5 % of people report motion sickness while trying VR for the first time. Sounds worse than it actually is. The motion sickness is a slightly dizzy state which occurs usually within 5-20 min. People start feeling a little uncomfortable and take of the VR glasses. Many VR reality solutions do not exceed this timeframe, so the motion sickness doesn’t even start in most cases and lowers the small percentage to almost non existing.

As you can see, the benefits of a VR solution are clearly more decisive than the downsides which are minor.

### So what is actually still stopping companies to use Virtual Reality?

This is the point where Visards innovative business model comes into play, as this is exactly what Visards team leaders were asking themselves in 2014 when founding the company. 
Here we come back to the two questions from the top of the article:
#### 1. Application Costs and
#### 2. Lack of knowledge about Virtual Reality.

First, let’s get to the second point, lack of knowledge about VR. 
Of course, if someone has never tried on VR glasses, it is not possible to understand the greatness and possibilities of the technology, most people don’t even think of VR as a marketing solution for the industry and are too much used to usual marketing methods. This is a reason why many people don’t even think of using VR solutions for their company - “a technology far away from imagination”. Even a search engine result doesn’t reveal a lot of industrial usage for VR applications yet. The way to overcome this is quite easy, just contact Visard, share your interests, discuss your thoughts and we will provide the possibility to make your first VR experience.

Still one point left, the development costs. This was holding back middle sized companies to get a VR solution for themself. At first, while ordering a VR solution, you are not sure if this application will have the desired effect, in addition you have to invest quite an amount of funds (easily into 6 figures). Visard’s answer is a subscription model. You pay a little amount (starting from only 260 EUR/month) and you are ready to go. In addition you get support and updates.

### Summary
Overall a Virtual trade show has only advantages and there are no doubts that in future more and more companies will present their machines in Virtual trade shows. It is also very possible that in future whole trade fairs will take place in VR. 
As this technology is just developing and the industry is experiencing the benefits of VR, your company can now be one of the first using VR solutions thanks to the business model of Visard.
