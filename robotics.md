Robotics and automation technology has the goal to run plans or machines with minimal human intervention. The lower the degree of human intervention the higher the degree of automation of an installation.
 

Autonomous systems rapidly reach high degrees of complexity as the number of sensors, actors, and size of control logic increase. Visualisation solutions support in designing, testing, presenting as well as explaining these complex systems.
